			*	Computing total rainfall
			*	(2025-4-16) I have always been consufed with how to compute total rainfall per admin unit (woreda), from pixel-level pentad data
				*	(i) Should I compute total rainfall per pixel, and then "aggregate" all those rainfalls over pixels witn a unit?
				*	(ii) Should I compute total rainfall per pixe, and then "average" them within a unit?
				*	Based on what I have searched on the Internet, (ii) seems the correct choice
					*	Source 1: https://spatialthoughts.com/2020/10/28/rainfall-data-gee/
						*	Under "Calculating Total Rainfall In a Region", It says "Now that we have computed an Image with the total rainfall for each pixel, we can compute "average" total rainfall in any given geometry using reduceRegion() function."
					*	Source 2: ChatGPT; rainfall is "depth" of water, so calculating total depth isn't something meaningful
					
					/*
					When you see CHIRPS (or any gridded precipitation) in millimeters, you're looking at a depth of water over each pixel's area, not a "count" that you simply add up.

					Mean of pixels ‚áí the representative depth (mm) of rain over your admin unit.

					Sum of pixels ‚áí (depth √ó number_of_pixels) ‚Üí yields mm √ó pixel_count, which doesn't correspond to a meaningful water‚Äëdepth.

				üìê Getting "Total" Water Volume vs. Depth

					Total Depth (mm) across the unit

						Conceptually, the average depth across all pixels is the depth that fell everywhere.

						So you use reduceRegions(..., ee.Reducer.mean()) on your summed‚Äëover‚Äëtime precip image.

					Total Volume (e.g. cubic meters) of water that fell

						Convert each pixel's depth to a volume:

							volume_per_pixel = precipitation_mm √ó pixel_area_m¬≤

						Then sum those volumes across all pixels in the admin unit:

							total_volume = ‚àë(volume_per_pixel)
					*/	
				
			*	Since we have "average pixel-level rainfall per pentad (mm/pentad) per woreda", "mean" variable as described above, we aggregate this over time to compute "average pixel-level rainfall per period (month, year, etc.)"
			*	Note that "sum" variable, total precipitation per woreda, isn't really meaningful as described on ChatGPT answer above.
			
		
		*	Since it is pentad data, we need to aggregate by month to merge it with temperatue data
